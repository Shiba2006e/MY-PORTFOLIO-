- **Link**: [drawing : https://github.com/Shiba2006e/MY-PORTFOLIO-/blob/main/Drawing1.pdf , subnet table :### IP Sub-netting for Group 10 (CLASS A IP range)

For Group 10, we will use a CLASS A IP range. Let's use the IP range `10.0.0.0/8` for this task.

#### Subnetting Plan
Given the requirements for each branch:
- **Gauteng**: 15 users
- **Cape Town**: 5 users
- **Free State**: 5 users
- **Eastern Cape**: 5 users

We will allocate subnets that can accommodate the number of users in each branch with some room for future expansion.

#### Network Address: 10.0.0.0/8

**1. Gauteng (15 users)**
- Needed: At least 15 + additional addresses for network, broadcast, etc.
- Closest power of 2: 32 (5 bits for hosts)
- Subnet Mask: /27 (`255.255.255.224`)
- Subnet: `10.0.0.0/27`
- Range: `10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.30`
- Broadcast: `10.0.0.31`

**2. Cape Town (5 users)**
- Needed: At least 5 + additional addresses
- Closest power of 2: 8 (3 bits for hosts)
- Subnet Mask: /29 (`255.255.255.248`)
- Subnet: `10.0.0.32/29`
- Range: `10.0.0.33 - 10.0.0.38`
- Broadcast: `10.0.0.39`

**3. Free State (5 users)**
- Needed: At least 5 + additional addresses
- Closest power of 2: 8 (3 bits for hosts)
- Subnet Mask: /29 (`255.255.255.248`)
- Subnet: `10.0.0.40/29`
- Range: `10.0.0.41 - 10.0.0.46`
- Broadcast: `10.0.0.47`

**4. Eastern Cape (5 users)**
- Needed: At least 5 + additional addresses
- Closest power of 2: 8 (3 bits for hosts)
- Subnet Mask: /29 (`255.255.255.248`)
- Subnet: `10.0.0.48/29`
- Range: `10.0.0.49 - 10.0.0.54`
- Broadcast: `10.0.0.55`

### Usable IP Address Table

| Branch         | Subnet         | Subnet Mask          | Usable IP Address Range | First Usable Address | Last Usable Address | Broadcast Address |
|----------------|----------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Gauteng        | 10.0.0.0/27    | 255.255.255.224      | 10.0.0.1 - 10.0.0.30    | 10.0.0.1             | 10.0.0.30           | 10.0.0.31         |
| Cape Town      | 10.0.0.32/29   | 255.255.255.248      | 10.0.0.33 - 10.0.0.38   | 10.0.0.33            | 10.0.0.38           | 10.0.0.39         |
| Free State     | 10.0.0.40/29   | 255.255.255.248      | 10.0.0.41 - 10.0.0.46   | 10.0.0.41            | 10.0.0.46           | 10.0.0.47         |
| Eastern Cape   | 10.0.0.48/29   | 255.255.255.248      | 10.0.0.49 - 10.0.0.54   | 10.0.0.49            | 10.0.0.54           | 10.0.0.55         |

This table shows the allocated subnets, subnet masks, usable IP address ranges, first and last usable IP addresses, and broadcast addresses for each branch in Group 10 using a CLASS A IP range.
